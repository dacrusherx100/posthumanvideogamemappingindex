Hello :)  So, this is a research index which I will eventually be moving to a github hosted website, hence the github link.  Though, for now, there is a Google Slides link below containing said index, but hopefully once I host it on github, the "website" is much less annoying to navigate.
Also, I'm sure you might be wondering what this index is actually about, and to that, I say that the index aims to reveal some narrative thread of extension past human and cartographic forms, studying video games and tentacular beings as through lines.
